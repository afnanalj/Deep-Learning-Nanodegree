# Nanodegre
This repository contains material related to Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program , the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, GANs ,weight initialization and batch normalization.
Here are notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by real people (Udacity reviewers).
Projects:
- Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns: Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
- Landmark Classification : Implement a Convolutional Neural Networks to detect and classify a discernable landmark in the image.
- TV Script Generation: Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
- Face Generation: Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
- Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
